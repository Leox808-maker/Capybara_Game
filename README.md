PERSONAL EXPERIENCE‚¨áÔ∏è

I am a 16 year old boy with a lot of experience in Python (I have also published other games if you are interested in trying them), so I have been quite fast in writing and solving bugs in the code, for this reason I have not stopped to leave explanatory comments within the program.

I am also doing a challenge with a friend of mine in which we have to, for a week, program as much as possible without breaks every day, and the most beautiful projects will win. The video will be out soon on Youtube!!

Note: The code was copied and pasted from another device of mine to allow full debugging, so the formatting of some functions may be off.
